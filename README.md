# AI-powered-customer-Retention-System
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using Machine Learning techniques.
Customer churn refers to customers who are likely to stop using a company’s service.

The main objective of this project is to identify such customers in advance so that businesses can take necessary actions to improve customer retention.

The project implements a **complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline**, starting from data preprocessing to model deployment. It includes handling missing values, feature transformation, feature selection, encoding categorical variables, data balancing, feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

After comparing multiple machine learning models, **Logistic Regression** is selected as the final model due to its strong performance on binary classification problems and good ROC-AUC score.

The trained model and preprocessing objects are saved and can be directly used for deployment in real-world applications.
